--TODO FILE--

(organized by highest to lowest priorities)

-- make something to end the game from admin panel.
-- add capability to edit the event from admin dashboard
-- add basketball functionalities and user interfaces
-- add more sports
-----------------------------------------------------

-- Possibilities --
-- ad banners on client side with Kenston team sponsors.
-- make a thing on index to view past scores and game results.


-- Thoughts -- 
-- Maybe for basketball implementation, we could get in touch with coaches and see what is necessary and what isn't for features.
